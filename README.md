### Description:ledger:    
Questor is an android application aiming to solve the problem of finding & searching a peculiar word from the books! It can not only scan texts from books, but also recognise texts from any hardcopy OR objects. It will allow you to capture text from camera.  
  
  
### How it works:question:  
Step 1: Click on "Detect Text" Button.  
Step 2: As soon as Questor recognise any text, it will form a rectangle around that text. Click on that rectangle.  
Step 3: After clicking, recognised text will be displayed.  
Step 4: Then search for any text that you want, and Line & Word Number (where this word is located at book/hardcopy) will be displayed!
